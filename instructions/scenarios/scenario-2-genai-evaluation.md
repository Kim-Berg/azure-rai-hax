# Task 1:Set up your project in Azure AI Studio
As prerequist for this lab you need to set up a project in Azure AI Studio(https://ai.azure.com/) and provision the required resources.

Make sure you have created the following resources:
- An Azure OpenAI resource
- An AI search resource
  
You'll need to deploy a chat completions model (e.g. gpt-35-turbo 1106) and a text embedding model (e.g. text-embedding-ada-002). Do this in the "deployment" tab in your AI studio project.

# Task 2:Build the search indexes using the playground 

# Task 3:Test manual evaluation feature 

# Task 3:Create a prompt flow for product-index only

# Task 4:Run RAI evaluation for product-index only flow

# Task 5:Create a prompt flow for multi-indexes

# Task 6:Run RAI evaluation for multi-indexes flow

# Task 7:Compare the two evaluation results
